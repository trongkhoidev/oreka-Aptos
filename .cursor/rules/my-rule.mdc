always scan the project once before editing
always automatically edit files whenever there is an error, or if it is necessary to edit for more accuracy
automatically search to find information and update the latest changes in the technology being used
after fixing an error, you must re-read it to see if any new errors appear or if the error has not completely disappeared, then you must continue editing until the error is gone.
When I send an error, if I have a code editing, always automatically do it to me, no need to ask my opinion again
